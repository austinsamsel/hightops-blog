I love [Pocket](https://getpocket.com). It's a modern bookmarking app. However, stuff I like tends to get lost in there. I've also noticed that once I've filed something in Pocket, if I don't return to it within a few weeks, I probably lose track forever.

So in 2016 I started a doc in which I save all the things that I really really like (as well as my Todo's and other ideas). Now that its getting kind of long, I still want to hold on to this stuff so I can continue to reflect on it.

The following is a list of resources and people/organizations I've found especially cool so far this year.

## People and Projects

### [awesome-app-ideas](https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas)
I already have at least 10+ side project ideas I want to build, but I thought this repo was pretty great incase I ever had coder's block or needed a small idea to try out while testing out some new technology.

### [Disk Cactus](http://diskcact.us/)
This is just a really cool company. I found out about them when my friend [Madelena](http://madelenamak.com/) gave me their [Emoji Keyboard](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diskcactus/the-emoji-keyboard-type-emoji-on-your-mac) for my birthday this year. Also, they officially incorporated their name in unicode for their ðŸ’¾ðŸŒµ emoji.

### [Because Recollection](http://www.because-recollection.com/)
This one has received a lot of attention. It's great.

### [Rally Interactive](http://beta.rallyinteractive.com/)
I really like their website and their work. Rally Interactive is an interaction design studio in Salt Lake City, Utah.

### [Stink Digital](http://www.stinkdigital.com/)
Another cool company. They created the super weird [hands.wtf](http://hands.wtf/) project.

### [Susan Lin](http://bysusanlin.com/)
Nice website with scrolling animation + highlights really great design/illustration work.

### [Bad ass use of technology](http://science.slashdot.org/story/16/02/20/1823241/a-19-year-old-made-a-free-robot-lawyer-that-has-appealed-3m-in-parking-tickets?utm_source=feedly1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed)
Some kid made a "free robot lawyer" that has appealed over $3M in parking tickets.

### [Google Maps Streetview Player](http://www.brianfolts.com/driver/)
This is something I always wanted to build... so I could take roadtrips using only google maps street view! Looks like this guy got to it first. Congratuations, its awesome!

This is a company in NYC. ðŸ’¯ for working with plants.

### [Voxel CSS 3D Rendering](http://www.voxelcss.com/)

### [Pantone Propaganda](http://www.lokidesign.net/journal/2016/2/22/the-propaganda-of-pantone-colour-and-subcultural-sublimation)
One of the most interesting articles having to do with design and culture I've read, ever.

## Useful Tools - Resources

### [Creating Personas](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/creating-personas/)
Important for UX, Design, thinking about your users.

### [Grid Paper](http://dottedpaper.com/)
I tend to do a lot digitally, but I thought this was cool to help with sketches.

### [Name That Color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED)
For stylesheet color variables to be namespaced more flexibly.

### [Accessibility](http://a11yproject.com/)

### [continuous visual integration](https://percy.io/)
The problem with CSS is changes you make to one page can have unintended effects to another without your realizing it. Percy is a service for continuous integration testing with CSS so you know what changes.

### [Not using JQuery when you don't need to](http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-vs-raw-javascript-2-css3-animation/)
Equivalents in vanilla javascript that you can use instead of JQuery. I tend to think in JQuery before Javascript when I'm writing presentational JS for static websites... its a nice to do without JQuery when its possible.

### [UI Examples](http://collectui.com/)
When I need some quick inspiration for designing user interfaces.

### [CSS Scroll Snap Points](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-css-scroll-snap-points/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-205&utm_medium=email)
Great example of a future/soon-to-be-current, CSS feature.
